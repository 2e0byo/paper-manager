# Paper Management Script

This is a very personalised paper management script which I use all the time. It
might be useful for you to build on, but it won't even run unless you happen to
be running i3/sway and have zathura installed.

Operation:

- open paper (on other monitor if possible)
- prompt for author (prefilling if possible)
- prompt for title (prefilling if possible)
- if told to do so, strip cover pages and copyright margins (makes printing booklets possible, otherwise the text is too small)
- save resultant file under programmatic name.

Then I move the file manually to the correct dir.
